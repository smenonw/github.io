      <description>What It Is WETHOD is the online tool to manage people and projects in a collaborative way. We aim to make the project management simple, distributing the responsibilities among all the team members and reducing stress derived from projects organization.
The result is a deeply integrated system that manages all the information which are essential for a project-oriented company: budget, planning, timesheet and activity report.
This enables WETHOD to create a system where everybody collaborate and keep information up to date, a system that rewards who done well and warns the others.</description>
